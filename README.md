# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualization

This project is a Python application that visualizes several pathfinding algorithms using the Pygame library.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to create walls, and set start and end points.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Visualize Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* (A star) algorithms.
- **Controls**: Easily control the application with keyboard shortcuts to start algorithms, reset the grid, and more.

## Controls

- `1`: Activate BFS algorithm
- `2`: Activate DFS algorithm
- `3`: Activate A* algorithm
- `0`: Generate a random seed
- `Space`: Clear all walls and paths
- `Esc`: Reset the grid to its initial state
- `Right Mouse Click`: Place start/end point
- `Left Mouse Click`: Place/remove walls

## Installation

## What I Learned

This project was a valuable learning experience in several ways:
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Implementing and visualizing different pathfinding algorithms improved my understanding of algorithmic design and efficiency.
- **Python Programming**: Enhanced my Python skills, particularly in using libraries like Pygame.
- **Problem Solving**: Each algorithm presented unique challenges in terms of implementation and optimization, which tested my problem-solving skills.
- **Project Design**: Learned about the importance of user interface design and user experience, making the tool intuitive and easy to use.
